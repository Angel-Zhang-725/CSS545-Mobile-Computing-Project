Intended platform for final project: iOS

Intended framework/programming language for your final project: Swift

Whether you want to explore cross-platform development: No

Include a brief explanation for your selections: 
I chose iOS and Swift based on two reasons.
First, Swift is a modern programming language for iOS/macOS development. Its syntax is clean and beginner-friendly.
Second, iOS devices are more uniform in terms of hardware, which makes development and testing simpler, as I wonâ€™t need to adapt to as many devices.
Third, I own iOS devices (iphone + MAC)
